This is some sample code created from a fresh flutter project to act as a playground for experimenting with the c2bluetooth library as it is being built

### workout duration demo


1. build and run app.
2. long press app on android(samsung) home screen. click the info button, go to permissions and enable location permissions
3. confirm bluetooth is on
4. turn on PM and go to the screen where you would connect something like the ergdata app (usually this is a connect button on the main menu)
5. open/run the app. it should do some discovery and show you a stroke rate: 0 message
6. hit back on the erg and set up a piece. Recommended to set a 20 sec (minimum allowed) single time piece. anything other than just row should work.
7. start the piece and take some strokes. after the piece is over you should see the distance you completed appear on screen
